Restaurant Website API Project

Overview
This project serves as a RESTful API solution for a restaurant website, developed using .NET 7.


Prerequisites
To run this project, the following prerequisites are required:

.NET 7

Visual Studio 2022 or a newer version

SQL Server for creating the database using the Code First approach


Key Features
Utilizes client-side JavaScript for interactive features

Implements password strength verification using the Zxcvbn package during user registration

Adheres to REST API architecture principles for robustness

Implements layered architecture for streamlined code organization

Deploys dependency injection for encapsulation and operational smoothness

Employ async/await for enhanced scalability

Adopts a Data-First approach with Entity Framework (EF) for managing object-oriented data

Monitors database operations effectively using the PROFILER tool

Benefits from enhanced project understanding with documentation through SWAGGER

Utilizes Data Transfer Object (DTO) entities for tailored client-specific data delivery

Employs AutoMapper for seamless object-to-DTO mapping

Manages code parameters efficiently with a dedicated configuration file for connection strings

Implements logging capabilities for informational data storage and sends email alerts to managers in case of errors leveraging the LOGGER library

Middleware implementation provides comprehensive error handling across all layers

Dedicated middleware ensures logging of critical user entry data


Usage
Feel free to explore and make use of our API project!
